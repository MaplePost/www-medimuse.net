        About StateSong Technology
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base font-montserrat mt-2">
        StateSong is a patented technology that converts biological data into
        music. The idea? Capture and record a muscial rendition of a targeted
        state, say calm or focused. Then, replay it to bring your mind and body
        into that state. Using StateSong as a biofeedback tool, we can entrain
        our minds and bodies towards deeper states of calm, focus, sleep,
        exercise, even happiness.
